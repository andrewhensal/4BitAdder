# 4BitAdder


A prototype of a 4 Bit adder that utilizes dip switches as input and 7 segment displays as output. Under intended functionality, A 7 segment display will corespond to each bank of dip switches allowing the user to see the decimal integer they are inputing, to verify the binary input on the switches is correct.

The sum will be displayed on a 7 segment display. If an overflow is detected, the 7 segment display will illuminate the decimal point. 

A TI SN74LS283N is used for computation because of its simplicity on both input and output sides and its simple IC form factor.

A TI  SN74LS47N is used as the 7 segment decoder. The 7447 will act as an intermediate, taking the value from the adder or dipswitches (in 4 bit) and display the result on the 7 segment display. 


This project is a work in progress and I intend to learn how to work with signal integrety and power analasys on altium, with this circut. 

Reach out with any corrections, adjustments or feedback on the design. 

Thanks for looking!
